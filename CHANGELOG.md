### Changed

- Better GPU memory management:
    - GPU Memory management is now delegated to pytorch. Before the change, we need to cleanup the GPU cache that pytorch created to call `cudaMalloc`, which not only is slow but also hampers the long-running training that dies due to Out Of Memory (OOM).
